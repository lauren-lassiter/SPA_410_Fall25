Leonor López de Córdoba lived an extraordinary life in 14th-century Castile, a period marked by political instability, dynastic struggles, and shifting power at court. Born into a noble family closely tied to the Castilian royal household, she experienced dramatic turns of fortune: the murder of her father, imprisonment, exile, a return to influence as a close advisor to Queen Catalina of Lancaster, and ultimately, the queen's enmity. 

What makes Leonor truly remarkable is that she left behind a text known as her *Memoirs*, which is widely considered the first autobiography written by a woman in the Castilian language. In a world where women’s voices were rarely recorded, Leonor dared to tell her story in her own words. Her text is not just a personal account: it’s a window into courtly life, female power, and survival in a turbulent medieval world dominated by men. The fact that she did this in the 14th century is nothing short of extraordinary.

In our course, we will engage closely with her *Memorias*, tracing the events Leonor recounts and placing them in historical context. Students will collaborate to transform her life story into an interactive digital StoryMap, using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). This project will not only help visualize her journey and relationships but also introduce tools and methods that can be applied in other courses and projects.

We will use this online freely available edition: López de Córdoba, Leonor. Memorias. Edited by María-Milagros Rivera Garretas and Christopher C. Oechler, Open Educational Resources, no. 6, 2018. <https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/oer/6>
